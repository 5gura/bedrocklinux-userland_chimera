# Package Manager Manager world file
#
# This file is expected to contain a list of
#
#     <stratum>:<package-manager><whitespace><package-name>
#
# entries which `pmm` can utilize synchronize against the system's list of
# explicitly installed packages.  A given line may contain multiple white space
# separated package names.  For example:
#
#     ### Bedrock Linux `make check` dependencies
#     # compilers
#     arch:pacman	gcc clang
#     # static check tools
#     arch:pacman	cppcheck shellcheck
#     # formatting tools
#     arch:pacman	indent shfmt
#     # libraries
#     arch:pacman	fuse3 uthash
#
# See `pmm --help | grep world` for a list of world file
# operations.
